<p>Journey to Oasis</p>
<p>It is a story/combat/gathering game. It is also the first game that I have made/am making.
    </p>
<p>The game is about a village that you must help from monsters and  ghouls by helping build infrastructure / fighting enemies /gathering resources and talking to the villagers about their  problems.
    </p>
<p>For now there is only a shop you can open by clicking on a villager and&nbsp; a map with a tree and a building.
    </p>
<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
<p>a, d , w, s = left, right, up, down
    </p>
<p>mouse click on on villager and in shop</p>
<h2>Usage AI</h2>
<p>I sometimes use Gemini to help me learn Godot and C# since this is my  first project, but I never copy anything without understanding it, and I  often customize it to suit what I’m working on.
